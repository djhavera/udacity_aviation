# Supply chain & data auditing
This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a Seller and Buyer. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A Buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally a Seller can mark an item as Shipped, and similarly a Buyer can mark an item as Received.

## Diagrams
These diagrams represent the basic manufaturing, warehousing, and selling of an Aviation part.

An activity diagram represents the flow from one activity to another in the system. It captures the dynamic behavior of the system. 

A sequence diagram represents interaction between objects in the order or the sequence in which the interactions take place. A state diagram is a type of behavioral diagram that shows how an object moves through various states within its lifetime.

A class diagram shows the structure of a system by modeling the systems classes, their attributes and methods, and the relationship among these objects. 

Contract AccessControl: Defines each actorâ€™s role

Contract Base is AccessControl: Defines structs, functions, etc

Contract Core is Base: Main contract that tracks part ownership from widget manufacturing

The DApp User Interface when running should look like...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd1309/tree/master/course-5/project-6
```

Change directory to ```project-6``` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
cd project-6
npm install
```

Launch Ganache:

```
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/ganache-cli.png)
Run Truffle Development

In a separate terminal window, Compile smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/truffle_compile.png)

This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle migrate
```
truffle migrate --network rinkeby

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/truffle_migrate.png)

Test smart contracts:

```
truffle test
```

All 10 tests should pass.

![truffle test](images/truffle_test.png)

In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:


```
npm run dev
```
